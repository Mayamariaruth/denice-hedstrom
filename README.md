# Denice Hedstrom Global

This site was created for the magical healer Denice Hedstrom. It aims to highlight who she is and what she brings to the world in her work for the purpose of manifesting women who deeply need her guidance and support to level up their lives and unshackle trauma and doubts that hold them back. 

This site hopes to be an invitation for women (of course, men are always welcome too!) looking for a change in their reality and a connecting portal for Denice and future clients.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

__Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar can be seen on all three main pages, as well as on the fourth contact form feedback page. 
  - It features the title with a link to the home page, home page, services page, contact page and social media links for easy access.
  - For mobile, it features a toggle button in the shape of a 'burger' (three horizontal lines icon) that is fully responsive when clicked, exposing and/or hiding the navigation bar. 
  - This feature is crucial for easy navigation on the page and to highlight the different sections available.

__Hero image__

- The hero image section consists of an image of Denice in action during a retreat banging on a shamanic drum she calls Luna. It's meant to immediately capture the user with the harmonius energy felt from the image, as well as showcase her work as a Shaman.
- It also consists of two text overlays which explain the purpose of the work Denice does, making it easier to catch the eye of the people who are there for 'Abundance. Purpose. Freedom'.

- This will also catch the eye of the people who resonate with the work she does.

# Design


### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

To deploy the site to Github pages, I went through below steps: 
- Go to the Settings tab of the project's Github repository.
- There is a General menu on the left side of the screen, go to Code & Automation and click Pages.
- Scroll down to the Build & Deployment section and choose the Source 'Deploy from a branch'.
- Below this, you choose the Branch 'Main' and the Folder '/root'.
- Press Save and go back to the Code page of your repository.
- After a couple minutes, refresh the page and the succesfully deployed site will be found on the right hand side of the page under 'Deployments' with the name "Github pages".
